# glucose-analysis

This repository contains the code I've used to gather and Analyze my glucose data using the Freestyle Libre 2 sensor. 

You can read more about the project in my blog post: [Hacking my Metabolism](https://zbeegnew.dev/life/hacking_my_metabolism/).

This projects consists of two main parts:
1) `telegram-bot` - a telegram bot which allowed me to log my food and drug data and store it a sqlite database
2) `data-analysis` - a collection of jupyter notebooks which I used to analyze my glucose data
